# StartYourDay

Start_Your_Day brings you a few warm-up ideas, factoids and possibilities to get each day going. You know how to wake up, scroll through social media for a touch of connection, and then get lost in the links? This is a calmer day-starter, to give you some nourishment for mind and spirit -- no links, no time-suck, just an awesome way to begin every day. 


The Start_Your_Day gem tells you the date and  the day of the year, to help you locate yourself in time. Then it offers you a daily meditation, a writing tip, a word-of-the-day and tidbits of five intriguing ideas. You can choose whether to see all of these, or choose among them). Whatever your choice, when you're done, you get a “follow your passion today message.”
